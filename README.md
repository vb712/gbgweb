## Student Innovation - Garbage detection using AI
### Solutions could be in the form of waste segregation, disposal, and improve sanitization system.

## Our project name is Garbage detection using AI
- Helps detects filled dustbins which needs to be emptied.
- The plan is to make front end as in websites and backend using GPT 4 vision API
- The problem is dustbins in populated places such as cafeteria are filled and arent emptied as the garbage collectors dont know when they are fulled or empty and with our
  project.They can know whether the dustbins have been filled or empty.This project would be scaled using drones to capture pictures of dustbins then to determine it is fulled or not using our project.
